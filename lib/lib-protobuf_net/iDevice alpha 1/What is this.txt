This archive is an **ALPHA** release of protobuf-net "v2", intended to help
people who are playing with protobuf-net on iPhone (etc) and in particular
with "unity" (http://unity3d.com/ - no association/affiliation).

This is *just* the core dlls; no tooling is provided.

The "Full Framework" protobuf-net  dll includes the pre-compiler code; an extra build
step is required (using this dll, and typically a small console exe) to pre-generate
the serialization dll for use with your DTO model.

In your device project, you need to include:
- your DTO / model library
- the generated serialization dll
- the "Mobile Devive" protobuf-net dll

This last dll is a cut-down version (excluding features like the compiler), which
uses different optimisations to ensure it can run unhindered on restricted runtimes.

As a pre-release package, I offer even less guarantees (of 100% correct behaviour)
than normal! Please run your own tests, and report any issues here:
