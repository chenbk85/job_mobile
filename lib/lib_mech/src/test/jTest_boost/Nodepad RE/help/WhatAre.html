<h4>What Are Regular Expressions?</h4>
<p>
A Regular Expression is simply some text.  I think it is safe to assume that anyone who has used a modern computer will have used Find and/or Replace dialogs in more than one application that allows text processing, whether it is notepad, a word processing program or a web browser.  At the simplest level a Regular Expression is no different to the text you type into the edit field of a Find dialog.
</p>
<p>
Where Regular Expressions differ to normal text is that they give special meaning to certain characters, allowing you to specify textual 'patterns' rather than just literal text.  The special characters are the following:
</p>
<p>
'<b>.</b>', '<b>|</b>', '<b>*</b>', '<b>?</b>', '<b>+</b>', '<b>(</b>', '<b>)</b>', '<b>{</b>', '<b>}</b>', '<b>[</b>', '<b>]</b>', '<b>^</b>', '<b>$</b>' and '<b>\</b>'.
</p>
<p>
These characters are often known as 'metacharacters' in the jargon of Regular Expressions.
</p>
<p>
If you have ever typed something like:</p>
<p>
<b>*.txt</b>
</p>
<p>
or something similar, then you are already familiar with the concept of characters having special meaning in a piece (string) of text.  Wildcards (the characters '<b>*</b>' and '<b>?</b>') used when negotiating most computer file systems, are a massively simplified version of Regular Expressions.  As well as being able to match any character ('<b>?</b>') or any string ('<b>*</b>'), Regular Expressions allow you to specify ranges of characters that can match, repeating textual patterns, alternative matching patterns and even matching <i>positions</i> within text.  Note that in the syntax of Regular Expressions the wildcard character '<b>?</b>' becomes '<b>.</b>' and '<b>*</b>' becomes '<b>.*</b>'.
</p>
<p>
If you have never used Regular Expressions before, then, once you have learnt the syntax, you are in for a pleasant supprise.  Once you have mastered their use, you will never look back!
