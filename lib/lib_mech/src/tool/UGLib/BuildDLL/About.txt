*** Linking to Ultimate Grid built into a DLL ***

When linking to the Ultimate Grid (that is built as a DLL) define _LINK_TO_UG_IN_EXTDLL
in your project and specify the path for the UG header files and the location of the compiled library.

The "BuildDLL" project can generate 4 variations of the Ultimate Grid DLL:

 - UGMFCD.dll (UGMFCD.lib)      - Ansi Debug
 - UGMFC.dll (UGMFC.lib)        - Ansi Release
 - UGMFCDU.dll (UGMFCDU.lib)    - UNICODE Debug
 - UGMFCU.dll (UGMFCU.lib)      - UNICODE Release

To simplify selection of the file you should be linking to we have created a simple routine, which is demonstrated in:

        "<UG install folder>\Examples\Use UG DLL\StdAfx.h"

*** Building Ultimate Grid into a DLL ***

The Ultimate Grid 6.1 has a new define (_BUILD_UG_INTO_EXTDLL), and once defined will mark for export
all of the UG classes, including additional celltypes and edit controls.  To simplify this process we have introduced
"BuildDLL" project that will build a UG DLL including all additional celltypes and edit controls.

*** MFC OLE ***

It is very important to understand the importance of MFC OLE and Ultimate Grid.  The Ultimate Grid will conditionally
compile-in code if MFC OLE has been included in the project.  As result both projects (the one that builds DLL and
the one that uses it) have to be synchronized.  You either include MFC OLE in both or in none.

If you decided to exclude MFC OLE in you application you must remove both "afxole.h" and "afxodlgs.h" from the
"StdAfx.h" in  the "Build DLL" project, then recompile DLLs.  Both of these files will result in inclusion of "afxole.h".
